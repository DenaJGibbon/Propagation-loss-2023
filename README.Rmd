# Propagation-loss-2023

Folders linked here: https://github.com/DenaJGibbon/Propagation-loss-2023/tree/main/R contain scripts for acoustic data processing and modeling.

Data for modeling is here: https://github.com/DenaJGibbon/Propagation-loss-2023/tree/main/dataformodeling


Note that the data for modeling is further processed in the 'modeling scripts' to calculate propagation loss. 

Here are some preliminary results:
