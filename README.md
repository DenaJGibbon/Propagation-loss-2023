# Propagation-loss-2023

Folders linked here:
<https://github.com/DenaJGibbon/Propagation-loss-2023/tree/main/R>
contain scripts for acoustic data processing and modeling.

Data for modeling is here:
<https://github.com/DenaJGibbon/Propagation-loss-2023/tree/main/dataformodeling>

Note that the data for modeling is further processed in the ‘modeling
scripts’ to calculate propagation loss.

Here are some preliminary results
